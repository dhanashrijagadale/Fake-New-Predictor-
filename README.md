# Fake-New-Predictor-
Fake News Detector 
The aim of the Project was to reduce the spread of fake news by using various Natural Language Processing Techniques. The 
fake news text was preprocessed using methods such as Porter Stemming, Text Normalization, Unicode Removal and stop words 
removal. A logistic Regression Algorithm was applied to the cleaned data which provided fairly accurate results in detecting fake 
news.
1. Machine Learning Algorithms and accuracy obtained: Logistic Regression algorithm (97.90 %)
2. Programming Language: Python
3. Tools and Methodologies Used: Data Pre-processing and Cleaning, Data Transformation, Natural Language Toolkit, Jupyter Notebook
